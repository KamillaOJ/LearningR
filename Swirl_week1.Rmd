## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# SWIRL
## general information on how to use swirl:
| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. If you are already at the prompt,
| type bye() to exit and save your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know you've done
| so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt,
| which will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup).
| Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

## what arguments can a function take?
Using the args() function on a function name is also a handy way to see what arguments a function can take.

## making a nested directory
Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2" and a subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all
| in one command by using dir.create() and file.path().
```{r}
dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE)
```

##Vectors

| The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called 'logical operators'. Other logical operators include `>`,
| `<=`, `==` for exact equality, and `!=` for inequality.
The same as in Python

| If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or'
| a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is
| the negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.


### combine charachters in a vector
| Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure there's a space between the double quotes in the `collapse`
| argument. You'll see why in a second.

| In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try
| paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " "), where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined
| elements with a single space.

## Subsetting vectors
 Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x) can be read as 'is not NA'.
| Therefore, if we want to create a vector called y that contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use
y <- x[!is.na(x)]. Give it a try.
```{r}
y <- x[!is.na(x)]
```

To get all positive values without NA, and the best way to solve the problem:
```{r}
x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]
```

## to get all values except some:
Luckily, R accepts negative integer indexes. Whereas x[c(2, 10)] gives us ONLY the 2nd and 10th elements of x,
| x[c(-2, -10)] gives us all elements of x EXCEPT for the 2nd and 10 elements.  Try x[c(-2, -10)] now to see this.

 A shorthand way of specifying multiple negative numbers is to put the negative sign out in front of the vector
| of positive numbers. Type x[-c(2, 10)] to get the exact same result.

## Dataframes
To assign column names to a DF:
```{r}
cnames <- c("patient", "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test")
colnames(my_data) <- cnames
```
